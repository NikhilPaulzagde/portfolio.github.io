                            <p ><strong>Company:</strong> Meriye LLC</p>
                            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Mar 2023 - Present</p>
                            <p><strong>Location:</strong> Nagpur, MH</p>
                            <p ><strong>Description:</strong> <p style="font-size:13px">During my internship at Meriye LLC, I served as a pivotal Data Analyst in the dynamic Food & Beverage industry. In the "Codex Analysis" project, I  managed a dataset of 10,000 records, employing SQL techniques like Joins, Count, Group by, Order by, Case statements, and Common Table Expressions (CTE). With Power BI and DAX, I crafted informative visualizations, including key performance indicators (KPIs), equipping the marketing team with data-driven decision-making capabilities. The insights I provided were instrumental in significantly enhancing our grasp of customer behavior and preferences, which, in turn, influenced marketing strategies and customer engagement.</p>

                                <p style="font-size:13px"> The "AtliQ Hospitality Analysis," I collaborated to strengthen AtliQ Grands' market presence and revenue through "Business and Data Intelligence." I was responsible for defining critical metrics and constructing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard, processing a vast dataset of 13,500 records using DAX functions such as SUM, COUNT, CALCULATE, and DIVIDE. My contributions transcended the initial project scope, offering substantial support to AtliQ Grands in their strategic decision-making processes, ultimately aiding the organization in regaining a competitive edge. As a Data Analyst, my work involved effectively translating data into actionable insights that significantly impacted marketing strategies and overall business success.</p>

                            <p><strong>Location:</strong> Nagpur, MH</p>
                            <p><strong>Description:</strong><p style="font-size:13px">During my virtual internship as a Data Analyst at MeriSkill from October 2023 to November 2023, I actively participated in three significant projects.</p>

                                <p style="font-size:13px">In "Project 1 - Sales Data Analysis," I harnessed Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning and manipulation, ensuring data accuracy. To make insights readily accessible, I employed Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization and created an interactive Sales Data Analysis dashboard using Power BI, providing a user-friendly interface for data exploration.</p>
                                
                               <p style="font-size:13px"> In "Project 2 - Diabetes Prediction," I utilized Pandas and NumPy for data preparation and leveraged Matplotlib and Seaborn for effective data visualization. I implemented data splitting using Scikit-Learn and applied machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier to train a predictive model, achieving good accuracy and developing a valuable predictive system.</p>
                                
                                <p style="font-size:13px"> in "Project 3 - HR Analytics," I used Pandas and NumPy for cleaning and preprocessing HR data, setting the stage for comprehensive analysis. I designed a Power BI dashboard, incorporating DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions, to provide in-depth insights and support data-driven decision-making in the HR domain. This internship enriched my skills in data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and predictive modeling, contributing to my growth as a data analyst.</p>

                                <p style="font-size:13px"> Cleaned up messy data about the Titanic using special tools (Pandas and NumPy). I also checked for weird numbers and got rid of them. If some information was missing, I fixed it to make sure the data was good.</p>
                                
                                <p style="font-size:13px">2.Analysed the numbers in the data and figured out things like the average (mean), middle number (median), most common number (mode), and how spread out the numbers were (standard deviation).</p>
                                                                
                                <p style="font-size:13px">3. Created visualization (like graphs) to help understand the data better. For example, I made a histogram to show how the data was spread out. I used tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, and NumPy to make the pictures look nice.</p>
                                
                                <p style="font-size:13px"> This internship helped me get better at working with data and understanding what the numbers mean, which is important for a data analyst..</p>
